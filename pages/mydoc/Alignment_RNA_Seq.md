# What is Alignment?

Alignment, in the context of sequencing data analysis, refers to the process of matching or aligning short sequence reads obtained 
from high-throughput sequencing technologies to a reference genome or transcriptome. The purpose of alignment is to determine the location 
or position in the reference sequence where each read likely originated from.
In RNA-seq, alignment refers to the process of mapping the RNA sequencing reads obtained from a sample to a reference genome or transcriptome. 
The goal of alignment in RNA-seq is to determine the locations in the reference sequence where the reads likely originated from, enabling the 
identification and quantification of the expressed genes and transcripts.

In this tutorial, alignment is a key step, which provides a significant advantage by enabling gene expression quantification. By aligning the RNA-seq reads to a 
reference genome or transcriptome, each read is assigned to a specific gene or transcript. This allows researchers to accurately quantify the expression levels of 
genes, providing valuable insights into which genes are expressed and at what levels in a given sample. Such information plays a crucial role in understanding 
the underlying biological processes.

# Alignment using HISAT2

## What is HISAT2?

HISAT2 is a popular alignment tool widely used in RNA-seq data analysis. It is specifically designed to align RNA sequencing reads to a reference genome 
or transcriptome accurately and efficiently. HISAT2  enables fast and memory-efficient alignment of reads. HISAT2 employs a hierarchical approach that 
efficiently handles both spliced and unspliced alignments, making it suitable for aligning reads to genomes with a large number of exons and 
alternative splicing events.

A few advantages of HISAT2 are listed below:

  1. Performance and accuracy: HISAT2 is known for its high alignment accuracy and robust performance, even when dealing with large and complex genomes. 

  2. Splice-aware alignment: HISAT2 has the ability to handle spliced alignments, enabling the accurate mapping of reads across exon-exon junctions. 
     This feature is particularly important for studying alternative splicing events and isoform expression analysis.
     
  3. Support for various organisms: Mention that HISAT2 is designed to align reads from a diverse range of organisms, including humans, 
     model organisms such as mouse, and plants. Its compatibility with different species makes it a versatile tool for RNA-seq analysis 
     across various research areas.

## How to use HISAT2.

Here's a simple step-by-step guide on how to use HISAT2 for Alignment:

To use HISAT2 for aligning RNA-seq reads to a reference genome or transcriptome, you can follow these general steps:

Indexing:

Before aligning reads, you need to build an index of the reference genome or transcriptome using HISAT2. This step needs to be done only once for a given 
reference.

Use the HISAT2-build command to create the index. For example:

Copy code
hisat2-build reference.fasta index_prefix
This command will generate several index files with the specified index_prefix.
Alignment:

Once the index is created, you can align the RNA-seq reads to the reference using the HISAT2 aligner.
Use the HISAT2 command with appropriate options to specify the input files, reference index, and other parameters. For example:

hisat2 -x index_prefix -1 reads_R1.fastq -2 reads_R2.fastq -S output.sam

In this example, -x specifies the path to the index files generated in the indexing step, -1 and -2 specify the paired-end read files, and -S specifies 
the output file in SAM format.

Adjust the command based on your specific input file formats and options required for your analysis.


Further analysis:

Once the alignment is complete and the BAM file is generated, you can proceed with downstream analysis tasks such as gene expression quantification, differential expression analysis, variant calling, or other RNA-seq analyses.
Various tools and pipelines are available to perform these analyses, such as HTSeq, featureCounts, Cufflinks, or DESeq2. Choose the appropriate tool based on your specific research question and analysis goals.
It's important to refer to the HISAT2 documentation and user manual for detailed information on available options, best practices, and specific considerations for your analysis.


      ```
      ## Run FASTQC
      fastqc -o [path_to_your_output_directory] -t [number_of_threads_to_use] input_file.fastq
      ```
      
## The samtools programm


Post-processing:

After alignment, you may want to convert the SAM output file to BAM format, sort the alignments, and create an indexed BAM file for efficient storage 
and further analysis.
Use tools such as Samtools to perform these post-alignment processing steps. For example:
samtools view -bS output.sam > output.bam
samtools sort output.bam -o sorted_output.bam
samtools index sorted_output.bam
These commands convert the SAM file to BAM, sort the alignments by genomic position, and create an index for the sorted BAM file.
